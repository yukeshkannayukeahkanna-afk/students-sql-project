# Student Performance Analysis (SQL)

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills by managing and analyzing a **student performance dataset**.  
It includes table creation, data insertion, queries for analysis, and updates—covering key SQL concepts useful for learning and portfolio purposes.

---

## Features / Skills Covered
- **Table Creation:** Using `CREATE TABLE` with primary keys and data types.  
- **Data Insertion:** Populating tables with multiple rows using `INSERT INTO`.  
- **Data Retrieval:** Selecting all columns, filtering with `WHERE`, sorting with `ORDER BY`.  
- **Aggregate Functions:** Calculating averages (`AVG`) and counts (`COUNT`).  
- **Grouping Data:** Using `GROUP BY` to analyze grades and gender.  
- **Updating Records:** Modifying data using `UPDATE`.  
- **Finding Top Performers:** Calculating total scores and identifying highest scorers.

## SQL Code Files
- `students_analysis.sql` → Contains all SQL commands for this project:
  1. Create `Students` table
  2. Insert student data
  3. Retrieve all student records
  4. Calculate average scores
  5. Calculate total scores and identify top scorer
  6. Count students by grade
  7. Average total score by gender
  8. Filter students based on Math score
  9. Update a student’s grade

---

## Sample Queries & Results
- Top performer by total score  
- Average scores per subject  
- Student count by grade  
- Gender-wise average total score  

*(Results can be seen by running the SQL code in MySQL, PostgreSQL, or DB Fiddle)*
